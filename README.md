# Freshworks Challenge

### JavaScript is ❤️

This repository is part of the Freshworks Challenge. 
I am Sharath Sriram and this is my submission - Frontend Assignment - Freshworks Challenge.

**So, what is so different about this submission?**

A small dive into SPA before I explain. SPAs (Single Page App) have exploded in popularity and by all means, for the right reasons. SPAs provide a modern architecture of the web that wasn't possible before. I, as a developer, love working on Single Page Applications. It makes the development process fun, intuitive and very rewarding. 

So, I would have gone on with this challenge, making an SPA but the rules clearly stated that I cannot use any JS Frameworks.

What did I do? - I felt this is an opportune moment to explore more. I have implemented (or at least, to a large part, tried to implement), a Single Page Application WITHOUT any JS FRAMEWORK. 

Was it the right thing to do? Perhaps.

Was it fun to do? Absolutely.

So, here I present to you, Country Explorer, made with generic DOM manipulation, minimal HTML, lots of JS and lots of passion. 

**But Sharath, where are the fancy animations and cool designs that everybody is after?**
